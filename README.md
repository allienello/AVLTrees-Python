# AVLTrees-Python
In this project, I implemented both a traditional BST and an AVL tree from the ground up in Python. Utilizing the AVL tree, I addressed a machine learning-inspired application problem.

This project was for my data structures and algorithms class at university. Areas of the code where it says 'Do not modify' were given by the instructor. Code indicated otherwise by 'Implement below', 'My code below', or 'Modify below' was implemented by me. 

Each function I completed had contraints I had to adhere to. This includes runtime and space complexity (as indicate by the docstrings), the skeleton of the function (declaration, parameters, return value), and the overall task or goal. 

Using my knowledge on data structures, specifcally BSTs and AVL trees, I implemented the algorithms for each. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks), as well as LLMs such as chatGPT when I was stuck on certain aspects. 

The application problem for this project was written by the instructor. Similar to the rest of the project, I was given the specifications for the function(s) and an explanation of the problem. 

//Application Problem Specs//

In the field of data science, the process of classification holds significant importance as it entails organizing data into distinct categories. This is where machine learning-based classifiers come into play, providing a more sophisticated and adaptable solution. Unlike their rule-based counterparts, machine learning classifiers acquire the ability to categorize new data by recognizing patterns in previously observed, labeled data. An exemplary instance of such a classifier is the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. Its operation involves comparing a new data point with its k closest neighbors, each having known class labels. In this task, you will be working with the NearestNeighborClassifier, an algorithm implementing one-dimensional k-Nearest Neighbors, to generate predictions based on given datasets. The process comprises two primary functions:

fit(): This function facilitates the training of the classifier using a training dataset consisting of (x, y) pairs. Here, x represents a feature (a float), and y denotes the target label (a string).

predict(): This function is responsible for predicting the class labels for a testing dataset containing x values. It leverages the patterns learned during the training phase to make accurate predictions.
